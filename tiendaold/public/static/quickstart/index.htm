	<p>Welcome to NeoInvoice! This Quickstart guide will help alleviate some of your
		likely questions regarding the application and should get you moving pretty
		quickly.</p>

	<p>To return to this guide at any point while using NeoInvoice, click the
	dashboard icon <img src="images/icons/dashboard.png" /> located at the top
	right corner of this middle panel, then click the Quickstart icon that appears.
	You will need to do this each time you follow one of the steps below.</p>

	<h3>New Company First Steps</h3>
	<p><small>Creating worktypes and clients are the first steps with your new NeoInvoice
		account. These are usually done up front and will likely not need to be
		updated until your business either changes it's rates or acquires more clients.</small></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a onClick="nw('detailPanel', 'company/preferences');">Set Contact Info</a> - Optionally set your company's address and phone number (printed on invoices).</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'worktype/add');">Create some worktypes</a> - A worktype is a kind of work you do for a client, such as graphic design, data entry, taking photos.</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'client/add');">Create your first client</a> - A client represents a person or company you perform work for.</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'project/add');">Create your first project</a> - This is a project that you work on for a client. You have to create the client before the project.</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'segment/add');" title="Record Time">Record some &quot;time segments&quot;</a> - Whenever you work on a project, record the time you spent on it.</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'invoice/add');">Create your first invoice</a> - Invoice your time segments once you've done enough work and would like to get paid soon.</li>
		<li><a onclick="nw('detailPanel', 'invoice/list_items');">Mail your first invoice</a> - When you are ready to mail your invoice click the mail icon next to the invoice.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Quick Application Overview</h3>
	<p>You must make clients before you make projects, and you must make projects
		and worktypes before you record time segments. You must record time segments
		before you can create invoices. It might sound confusing at first, but just
		follow the bullet points above and you shouldn't have any problems!</p>
