	<h1>Thank you for your payment</h1>

	<p>Thank you for your payment via PayPal. Your company is now in the process of
		being upgraded. This process may take a few minutes depending on how long it
		takes for PayPal to confirm the payment and how many other people are also
		getting account upgrades.</p>

	<p>Your application should still be open in another tab or window, switch back
		to it and refresh the page and your account should be updated momentarily.
		If you don't still have the window open you can go back to the application
		by clicking <a href="app">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do I know if my account was upgraded?</h2>
	<p>Go back to the application, click the Administration dropdown, and click the
		Company Preferences option. On this screen you will be able to see your
		current company account.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions concerning your companies upgrade, visit the
		<a href="contact">contact</a> form and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
